Most of it is extracted as a byproduct in the mining of other metals, usually platinum and nickel.<p><p>Its key commercial use is as a critical component in catalytic converters - a part of a car's exhaust system that controls emissions - found mainly in petrol and hybrid vehicles.<p><p>The vast majority of palladium, more than 80%, is used in these devices that turn toxic gases, such as carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide, into less harmful nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water vapour.<p><p>It is also used, to a far lesser extent, in electronics, dentistry, and jewellery.<p><p>The metal's soaring value in recent years has seen a jump in the theft of catalytic converters around the world.<p><p>London's Metropolitan police said the number of thefts in the first six months of 2019 were more than 70% higher than the whole of the previous year.<p><p>In short, it is because demand for palladium outstrips supply, and it has done for some time.<p><p>The amount of the metal produced in 2019 is forecast to be below global demand for the eighth year in a row.<p><p>As a secondary product of platinum and nickel extraction, miners have less flexibility to increase palladium output in response to rising prices.<p><p>And that shortfall looks set to continue, with South Africa, which produces around 40% of the world's supply, last week saying its output of platinum group metals, including palladium, fell by 13.5% in November compared to a year earlier.<p><p>Meanwhile, demand for palladium from car makers has increased sharply for a number of reasons.<p><p>Around the world governments, notably China, are tightening regulations as they attempt to tackle air pollution from petrol vehicles.<p><p>At the same time the diesel emissions scandal in Europe has also had an impact. Consumers there have been shifting away from diesel cars, which mostly use platinum in their catalytic converters, and are instead buying petrol-driven vehicles, which use palladium.<p><p>The US-China trade deal, which was signed earlier this month, has also boosted prices. Traders expect the agreement to help ease downward pressure on global economic growth and slow the decline in Chinese car sales.<p>",

On Monday, Beijing repeated its calls for Canada to release Ms Meng.<p><p>Meanwhile, the Chinese telecoms giant said it stood by its executive \"in her pursuit of justice and freedom\".<p><p>In a video statement released on its social media platforms as the hearing got underway, Huawei said it trusted in Canada's judicial system \"which will prove Ms Meng's innocence\".<p><p>This first phase of hearings is scheduled to run from 20-24 January in the British Columbia supreme court in Vancouver.<p><p>The court will hear arguments on whether the crime Ms Meng is accused of by the US would also be considered a crime in Canada.<p><p>The judge must be satisfied that it meets the so-called \"double criminality\" test before agreeing to an extradition.<p><p>Her lead defence lawyer, Richard Peck, argued in court on Monday that Canada is effectively being asked \"to enforce US sanctions\".<p><p>\"Sanctions drive this case,\" he said.<p><p>\"This case is founded on allegations of breach of US sanctions, which Canada has repudiated. The US has cast (Ms Meng's) alleged behaviour as a fraud against a bank.

The case has pulled Canada into a trade dispute between the US and China.<p><p>With a final decision some time away, that political attention will likely last for months to come.<p><p>Ms Meng's arrest also led to a trade row between Canada and China, with China blocking tens of millions of dollars of canola exports.<p><p>China says the case is political persecution by the US.<p><p>Washington has been lobbying its allies - including the UK - to not use Huawei's 5G technology services in critical communications infrastructure, alleging it could be a security threat.<p><p>If a judge is satisfied with the evidence presented, he or she will authorise that the individual be committed for extradition.<p><p>If not, the accused will be discharged and released from custody.<p><p>Even if the judge recommends extradition, it is the federal justice minister who makes the ultimate decision.<p><p>A second scheduled hearing, focusing on allegations of abuse of process and whether Canadian officials followed the law while arresting Ms Meng, is due to be heard in June.<p><p>It is highly likely the overall process could be lengthy. Ms Meng has avenues to appeal throughout the process and some extradition cases have dragged on for years.<p>",

        "content": "<p>US officials may put an end to a civilian drone programme because of their concerns about the unmanned aerial vehicles that are made in China. The officials are apparently worried that the Chinese-made drones could be used to spy on people in the US.<p><p>After a volcano exploded in Hawaii in May 2018, US scientists used drones to save a man from the lava: \"Follow the drone,\" they said. He made it through the jungle.<p><p>Drones save people. They also map terrain, survey land and inspect pipelines. The scientists use drones for these and other purposes on a daily basis, and they have bragged about their successes in the field.<p><p>Many of the aircraft are made by Chinese companies, though. They are now grounded because of concerns about espionage.<p><p>The drones had been deployed for years by the scientists and others at the US Department of the Interior, a federal agency that manages national parks and other duties. But the head of the federal agency, David Bernhardt, is apparently now worried that the drones could be used for espionage.<p><p>He is examining the agency's civilian drone programme in an effort to determine whether or not it should be continued. During this time, many of the drones are grounded, according to an agency spokeswoman, Melissa Brown. \"Until this review is completed, the secretary has directed that drones manufactured in China or made from Chinese components be grounded,\" according to a statement she sent to the BBC.<p><p>Drones that are used to fight fires and help rescue people are still allowed to fly, she added. News of the fleet's grounding was first reported in the Financial Times.<p><p>Mr Bernhardt's review of the drone programme reflects a growing concern among US officials about Chinese technology and espionage.<p><p>President Donald Trump has spoken in dark terms about China, saying that its leaders have \"cheated\" the US and that its intelligence agents spy on people here. Chinese officials deny the accusations. Despite the rhetoric, US-China relations have improved.<p><p>On Wednesday, Trump is planning to sign an initial trade deal with Chinese leaders. Still, fundamental issues remain, such as the fight over technology. US officials have said in the past that Huawei, the telecommunications company, and other Chinese companies could pose a security threat.<p><p>Some Chinese analysts say the fight is not over national security but market share. The Chinese are better at making products, they say, and Americans are jealous. The Chinese analysts see the US policies as a form of protectionism.<p><p>The drones are now at the centre of the US-China dispute.<p><p>Many of the drones that are used by US scientists are made by a Shenzhen-based company called Da Jiang Innovations Science and Technology Company, or, DJI. The company dominates the drone market, according to a research company, Skylogic.<p><p>US officials have in the past expressed concerns about DJI. Agents at a US immigration office said in 2017 that the company's drones could collect information about US sites and transmit data back to Beijing.<p><p>Rules and norms are different for private companies in China than they are in the US. Business executives in China stay in close contact with government officials. US officials worry about the information that Chinese drones could collect and what might be done with the data.<p><p>The Chinese executives could pass the data on to Beijing officials, explains Sarah Cook, a senior analyst with Freedom House, a non-profit organisation.<p><p>Executives who work for DJI say their drones are trustworthy. Michael Oldenburg, a spokesman for DJI Technology Inc, tells the BBC there is no \"credible evidence to support a broad country-of-origin restriction on drone technology\".<p><p>Many US analysts agree with Oldenburg's assessment. \"I doubt the Chinese government is using the drones to conduct massive surveillance,\" says David Fidler, an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.<p><p>Fidler and others admit it is impossible to know how much information the drones are gathering, however. Analysts emphasise that the Chinese officials pose a threat to the US and that Chinese companies should be banned from certain kinds of work.<p><p>\"I wouldn't want a Chinese server operating our nuclear system,\" says Paul Rosenzweig, a senior fellow at the conservative R Street Institute who served as a US Department of Homeland Security official during the George W Bush White House years.<p><p>Yet Rosenzweig and others say that the drones seem benign. The aircraft fly over wildlife areas and parks and are unlikely to collect sensitive data. \"It is an acceptable risk,\" Rosenzweig says, adding: \"I don't think drones covering Yosemite National Park are a real threat.\"<p><p>The real assessment, the one from the secretary of the interior, is yet to be announced, however. In the meantime, scientists and others wait - and wonder - about the fate of the drones.<p>",

One said social media had become \"a catalogue\" for men to select their next conquest.<p><p>\"It's high-end prostitution - it's just scary to think if they've messaged me, they've probably sent it to thousands of pretty girls on Instagram,\" says Tyne-Lexy Clarson.<p><p>She says she was only 19 when she was first propositioned, with an offer of \u00a320,000 for dinner and drinks.<p><p>But after starring in series two of Love Island, an agency emailed, offering her \u00a350,000 for five nights in Dubai. It contained a non-disclosure agreement, stating that the details of what she would be required to do would remain confidential.<p><p>Tyne-Lexy says she refused the offer, but fears that struggling influencers who do not receive luxury items for free would feel pressure to \"keep up appearances\" and become vulnerable to these kinds of transactions.<p><p>\"It's a lot of money for some people, it's life-changing amounts of money.\"<p><p>Rosie Williams, who starred in series three of Love Island, says she was offered \u00a3100,000 a year plus all her clothes and bags, to become a companion to a man in Dubai.<p><p>She showed us one of the recent messages she had received, from a man purporting to be in Dubai. It says she may be surprised to hear from him but he has an \"important transaction\" he wishes to share - which she says is a common turn of phrase in these messages.<p><p>And she says she would never be tempted, despite the large amount of money involved.<p><p>Rosie says it is not an aspect of fame she anticipated: \"You're warned about trolling, you're warned that your life will change dramatically, but you're never warned that you could get bought by men.\"<p><p>And she says it is not spoken about in influencer circles: \"We either aren't in a position where we need to do it so we don't speak about it, or we've done it and we're too ashamed.\"<p><p>This programme has seen several messages which influencers have received. The approaches vary from men directly suggesting sex, to agents acting on behalf of a wealthy client.<p><p>We received anonymous written evidence from a person claiming to be a British reality star, who said she had been offered \u00a310,000 for sex as part of a holiday package.<p><p>\"Isabel\" said she was first approached on Instagram by a man 10 years older than her, after she had competed in a TV talent show.<p><p>\"I was initially offered designer handbags. He had a fetish for being financially dominant so he would get a sexual kick out of spending hundreds and hundreds of pounds on bags for me,\" she explained. \"I would also struggle to keep my followers engaged online. So I guess that's why I accepted the offer. \"<p><p>She said they did not meet for 18 months and spoke every day, so she was excited to meet him.<p><p>\"He was really pleasant when I was there. At dinner we started drinking and he was asking about my finances - I explained I was in \u00a35,000 of debt. He said: 'Have sex with me and I'll give you double that'.\"<p><p>\"Isabel\" said she went up to his hotel room and went through with it. \"I felt a kind of a mixture of degraded, really annoyed at myself, violated.\"<p><p>But she insists it is not a form of prostitution: \"It is a targeted relationship that progresses over time... Whereas I think prostitution is when you agree a fee with a stranger.\"<p><p>The feminist group, Object, which campaigns against the sexual objectification of women, said it understood why women accepted the \"hugely tempting\" offers.<p><p>Heather Brunskell-Evans said: \"The women who are involved with this will not want to hear the word prostitution. The reality is that they are selling their bodies for money.<p><p>\"The groomers are offering the woman everything she needs to be a success at her job as an influencer, but ultimately it's exploitation, and that woman will have to do things for that money that she doesn't want to associate herself with, that make her feel shamed.\"<p><p>Celebrity agent Rob Cooper said it was not only women who were approached. He said one man who was posting online was regularly offered money to perform sex acts.<p><p>\"I would say a high-level influencer or reality star receives these messages every single day.\"<p><p>He added that social media platforms should find a way of making people accountable to their account - using something like a passport or national insurance number - so that if they're blocked they would have to appeal to get their account reinstated.<p><p>A Facebook company spokesman said: \"Sexual solicitation is not tolerated on Instagram, and those who repeatedly break our guidelines will be banned. We want Instagram to be a safe space for people to express themselves. We invest heavily in tools and technologies to prevent harassment on the platform.\"<p><p>Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here.<p>",

        "content": "<p>In 1985 the US pulled the plug on a computer-controlled anti-aircraft tank after a series of debacles in which its electronic brain locked guns onto a stand packed with top generals reviewing the device. Mercifully it didn't fire, but did subsequently attack a portable toilet instead of a target drone.<p><p>The M247 Sergeant York (pictured above) may have been an embarrassing failure, but digital technology and artificial intelligence (AI) have changed the game since then.<p><p>Today defence contractors around the world are competing to introduce small unmanned tracked vehicles into military service.<p><p>Just like an army on the move, there are contrasting views about how far and how fast this technology will advance. Above all, designers are testing the limits of human control and machine independence, the ultimate goal of autonomy.<p><p>Will this new generation of mini-tanks change the face of warfare? How much autonomy can they be trusted with?<p><p>Estonian soldiers currently serving in Mali are going out on patrol with an unmanned ground vehicle or UGV. The size of a sit-on lawn-mower with tracks, it carries heavy supplies such as water and ammunition. Trundling behind a conventional armoured personnel carrier it resembles an obedient younger sibling.<p><p>UK defence technology group Qinetiq presented the British army with a selection of these vehicles during a month-long trial on Salisbury Plain in late 2018. The basic UGV came from the Estonian company Milrem, but Qinetiq integrated a series of technology options onto it to create a trio of military roles.<p><p>More Technology of Business<p><p>Depending on the option chosen the UGV, known as Titan, can carry supplies or a heavy machine gun, or it can stand guard over its human comrades, using infra-red sensors and thermal imaging to supplement a battery of cameras.<p><p>Running on an electric-diesel hybrid engine Titan can be controlled by a human operator or sent off to perform tasks directed by its own software which can decide when to switch between power sources.<p><p>Keith Mallon is in charge of UGVs at Qinetiq. While a small tank weaving across a muddy plain is a curious sight, he focuses on the digital contents of the UGV.<p><p>\"We've had robotics for years, but the information revolution means it can navigate on its own.\"<p><p>Machine learning, a subset of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, means software embedded in Titan recognises patterns. Data from its cameras and other sensors is matched to prior examples so it can navigate to a chosen destination.<p><p>The idea is to have minimal human intervention while Titan goes about supporting the troops or exploring a dangerous area. But the freedom Qinetiq will grant to the UGV is strictly limited.<p><p>When it comes to firing a gun or anti-tank missile mounted on the chassis a human must always be in the loop to decide on the use of lethal force. \"We will never give software the capability to fire a weapon,\" says Keith Mallon.<p><p>Does all this mean robot mini-tanks have really won acceptance?<p><p>Nick Entwistle spent 19 years serving in the British army in tanks and armoured vehicles. Today he advises the army and has studied the results of the Salisbury Plain trials. He points out that warfare throws up choices that go way beyond the capabilities of current AI technology.<p><p>\"Even humans have trouble discriminating between a civilian and a combatant. And human beings are adept at reading situations. But look at Afghanistan where the enemy hid among civilians. So autonomy is not going to happen for some time. The technology is further away than some like to think.\"<p><p>Across the Atlantic US defence contractor FLIR has been buying up robotics firms in order to put together a UGV package with a group of technology and engineering firms, Team Ripsaw. This group has adapted the Ripsaw, a small tracked vehicle with sports car speeds popularised on TV and by Hollywood.<p><p>Originally marketed as a millionaire's plaything and subsequently starring in Fast and Furious 8, the Ripsaw may be about to earn further recognition as an unmanned war machine.<p><p>It has been chosen for detailed testing by the US Army's Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) programme. After evaluating a whole crop of UGVs the army intends to field some for real by the mid-2020s.<p><p>Team Ripsaw uses a handful of sophisticated visual and thermal sensors to see all around the UGV in day and night. These sensors live inside a gimbal on a mast that can be extended to peer far and wide. The big challenge is to pre-plan a mission and then let the UGV go and do it independently of an operator with radio control. This is where AI comes in.<p><p>David Ray is a senior FLIR executive and ex-US Air Force communications expert who served on Air Force One. As he sees it AI is \"about object detection, how you tell the difference between a broomstick and a gun\".<p><p>Again, machine learning is the key, showing the Ripsaw's digital mind a succession of images that build up a comparative picture of the world.<p><p>Self-driving cars can be programmed to recognise everyday events from videos. But you simply cannot show a machine real images of every possible situation that might arise in war.<p><p>So synthetic training aids, familiar from flight simulators and using hyper-realistic computer-generated images have been brought to bear. These reflect combat conditions. The machine-learning software builds up a library of capabilities as it absorbs images of conflict.<p><p>This merging of different technologies represents a big breakthrough for UGVs.<p><p>David Ray talks of the Ripsaw as \"very fast and flexible and able to traverse difficult terrain such as sand dunes\". It uses an electric-diesel hybrid motor that can transition to a silent approach in stark contrast to the barrage of noise laid down by conventional tanks. The US Army wants a discreet machine that can creep up on its target.<p><p>The real revelation about the Team Ripsaw vehicle lies in what FLIR calls its marsupial character. The little tank can open a hatch under its angled front to disgorge a junior robot partner, a smaller tracked machine based on a bomb disposal robot. This scuttles away into confined spaces to look for enemies lurking inside buildings or to detect toxic substances such as nerve agents.<p><p>The robot family doesn't stop there. A quadcopter drone can rise from the rear of the UGV to carry out aerial reconnaissance on behalf of its terrestrial team-mates.<p><p>This is layered surveillance, keeping manned vehicles well back from danger while a trio of tech-heavy toys spy on threats. Like Titan, Team Ripsaw has an armed option which resembles a smaller version of a normal tank.<p><p>As with his UK counterparts, David Ray is emphatic that a human will always be in the loop before firing.<p>",

Aircraft are getting more efficient, but airline traffic is growing even faster.<p><p>Rolls-Royce estimates that 37,000 new passenger aircraft will be needed over the next 20 years.<p><p>More Technology of Business<p><p>\"We've come a long way, but the challenge is to decouple emissions growth from traffic growth,\" says Alan Newby, future programmes director at Rolls-Royce.<p><p>The new engine will also incorporate a gearbox, allowing a much bigger fan, which results in a more efficient engine.<p><p>It's an innovation already being used on a smaller engine from US-based Pratt & Whitney Engine, the PW1000G.<p><p>While Rolls-Royce and others in the aerospace industry are working on electric and hybrid propulsion systems for aircraft, for long-haul aircraft, at the moment jet engines are the only option.<p><p>Given that it is a technology that has been around since World War Two, how much more efficiency can be squeezed out of the jet engine?<p><p>Quite a lot, according to Professor Pericles Pilidis, who is head of power and propulsion department at Cranfield University's Centre for Propulsion Engineering.<p><p>His department works with on research projects with aerospace companies including Airbus and Rolls-Royce.<p><p>\"I do expect improvements to continue,\" he says. Better materials, more efficient shapes and improved coatings can all contribute to make engines lighter and stronger.<p><p>He also points out that lighter engines mean the aircraft structure can be lighter as it has to carry less weight.<p><p>Those kind of incremental changes might not sound like much, but in the airline business they can make a big difference.<p><p>\"Evolutionary changes, they sound unimpressive - 10% here 12% there. But in the airline business with very thin margins, that is the difference between life and death,\" says Richard Aboulafia, vice-president of analysis at the Teal Group.<p><p>One UK firm though is looking to make a step change in propulsion. Reaction Engines is developing a rocket engine, called Sabre, to be used on high-speed aircraft and on spacecraft.<p><p>At the kind of speeds Reaction is aiming for, Mach 5 (five times the speed of sound) the air coming into the engine can reach temperatures of 1,000C.<p><p>That temperature would destroy the engine, so Reaction has developed a cooling system which can chill the incoming air in a fraction of a second.<p><p>The so-called pre-cooler is made from miniature tubes, less than 1mm thick, that can pipe coolant under high pressure through the system, and whisk heat away.<p><p>\"The Sabre is completely unique, there's nobody else in the world, that we are aware of, that's developing an air-breathing rocket engine,\" says Mark Thomas, chief executive of Reaction Engines.<p><p>\"Our pre-cooler technology... is in a different class to anything out there. It's ultra-high performance, ultra lightweight, highly miniaturised... it's just in a different league completely.\"<p><p>Reaction Engines plans to start building the Sabre engine this year and test it in 2021.<p><p>Reaction's pre-cooler can also potentially be used on conventional jet engines to make them more efficient, an idea being tested with Rolls-Royce.<p><p>According to Prof Pericles it will be another 30 years until we see a radical change in passenger aircraft.<p><p>By then he thinks there will be a transition from the current design, which is basically a tube, with engines hanging below the wings, to a \"blended wing\" design.<p><p>Under that design, the aircraft is just one set of wings, with engines sitting on the top.<p><p>Those engines might even by powered by hydrogen, which has the potential to be a very low emission fuel.<p><p>\"Hydrogen fuel is unavoidable,\" says Prof Pilidis. \"It is a long-term solution to decarbonise aviation completely.<p><p>However, environmentalists says action needs to be taken sooner.<p><p>\"There's always a role for technology to play in cutting emissions, but solving the climate crisis is something we need to get on with right now,\" says Jenny Bates, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth.<p><p>\"The priority instead needs to be emissions cuts by having fewer planes in the sky. This is a crucial part of preventing further climate breakdown.\"<p>",

I think it will be as ordinary as keeping children safe by putting on a seat belt.\"<p><p>Ms Denham said the move was widely supported by firms, although added that the gaming industry and some other tech companies expressed concern about their business model.<p><p>She added: \"We have an existing law, GDPR, that requires special treatment of children and I think these 15 standards will bring about greater consistency and a base level of protection in the design and implementation of games and apps and websites and social media.\"<p><p>The new standards follow concerns over young people suffering from grooming by predators, data misuse, problem gambling and access to damaging content which could affect their mental health.<p><p>Ian Russell believes his daughter Molly's use of Instagram was a factor in her suicide aged 14 in 2017.<p><p>After she died, her family found graphic posts about suicide and self-harm on her account.<p><p>The response following her death led to Instagram pledging to remove images, drawings and even cartoons showing methods of self-harm or suicide.<p><p>Welcoming the code, Mr Russell said: \"Although small steps have been taken by some social media platforms, there seems little significant investment and a lack of commitment to a meaningful change, both essential steps required to create a safer world wide web.<p><p>\"The Age Appropriate Design Code demonstrates how the technology companies might have responded effectively and immediately.\"<p><p>Andy Burrows, the NSPCC's head of child safety online policy, said the code would force social networks to \"finally take online harm seriously and they will suffer tough consequences if they fail to do so\".<p><p>He said: \"For the first time, tech firms will be legally required to assess their sites for sexual abuse risks, and can no longer serve up harmful self-harm and pro-suicide content.<p><p>\"It is now key that these measures are enforced in a proportionate and targeted way.\"<p><p>Facebook said it welcomed \"the considerations raised\", adding: \"The safety of young people is central to our decision-making, and we've spent over a decade introducing new features and tools to help everyone have a positive and safe experience on our platforms, including recent updates such as increased Direct Message privacy settings on Instagram.<p><p>\"We are actively working on developing more features in this space and are committed to working with governments and the tech industry on appropriate solutions around topics such as preventing underage use of our platforms.\"<p>",

US politicians are also pushing allies including the UK, Germany and South Korea to block Huawei from their markets.<p><p>The conversation with Mr Purdy took place outside the courthouse in Vancouver, Canada, where Ms Meng's hearing is taking place.<p><p>The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.<p><p>How do you feel Meng Wenzhou's hearing is going so far?<p><p>We believe the lawyers for Ms Meng have been able to make the very strong case that there are no grounds for extradition.<p><p>Hopefully soon, neither while Ms Meng nor Canada will be in the middle of this kind of trade war between the US and China.<p><p>Meng Wanzhou was a key player in Huawei's efforts to build a global 5G network. If she is extradited and if she is convicted - how will Huawei deal with the loss?<p><p>Ms Meng is very important to the leadership and the conduct of our business globally\u2026on one level, she's irreplaceable.<p><p>But we always have to have a succession plan, we have to have the ability to proceed if something happens. So if we have to proceed without her, it's going to really be a shame.<p><p>The substantive work on 5G continues\u2026 and we're making tremendous progress. We're about 18 to 24 months ahead of the competition [on 5G] and everybody recognises that.<p><p>In 2019 the US labelled Huawei a security risk - barring US suppliers from selling to it. How has Huawei been coping without having access to these suppliers?<p><p>We have nearly 300 American suppliers that would like to continue to sell to Huawei.<p><p>That amounts to about 40 to 50,000 American jobs directly and indirectly impacted... and it's going to be a challenge as we move forward. But our revenues for 2019 were strong - up over 18%.<p><p>This year [2020] is going to be a difficult year. But the fact is, none of our executives are going to lose their jobs.<p><p>We're going to continue to grow our business and we're going to continue to succeed.<p><p>Where does Huawei see the best opportunities for growing its presence in 5G?<p><p>The whole world is a big opportunity for 5G. Some of the most promising countries around the world are places like South Korea, obviously, China. We've just gotten approval in India to proceed.<p><p>We see some of the European countries are really moving forward quite quickly with 5G.<p><p>And in fact, the UK parliamentary committee report said the UK will be less secure if Huawei is not part of the network\u2026 because a diverse system of suppliers helps ensure that despite potential major attacks, the systems are kept up and running.<p><p>How confident is Huawei that it will give approval for it to be part of the 5G network in the UK?<p><p>Well, I wouldn't say we're confident that the UK is going to include Huawei - although a number of statements by senior government officials seem to be pointing in a positive direction.<p><p>So we have our fingers crossed, we hope and expect that they'll make a decision that's for the best for the people of the United Kingdom.<p><p>What kind of impact has all of this had on Huawei's relationship with the United Kingdom?<p><p>We've been working very closely with the four major carriers in the UK, and with the UK government.<p><p>It's a very strong relationship over many years. We are having substantive discussions - that aren't mired in politics - around transparency and cyber security.<p><p>Because this technology really matters, it has to be provided in a secure way to citizens and organisations of the country - and it's possible so that we could all take advantage of these technologies.<p><p>Ms Meng was arrested in December 2018 during a layover in Vancouver. She is accused by US authorities of lying to banks in order to avoid American sanctions on Iran. She denies the charges.<p><p>Huawei has said it has trust in Canada's judicial system \"which will prove Ms Meng's innocence\".<p><p>Her lawyers argue extradition would mean Canada was in effect upholding US sanctions on Iran.<p><p>Lawyers for Canada's attorney general have focused their arguments on the accusations of bank fraud.<p><p>The extradition hearing is expected to run 20-24 January. But a decision by the presiding judge is expected to take several more weeks.<p>",
